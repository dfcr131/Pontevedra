1 MICHELIN Star: High quality cooking, worth a stop!
If you’re looking for a restaurant that exudes the true spirit of Pontevedra, then look no further, as Eirado occupies one of the most charming properties in the town’s old quarter. Its compact dining rooms are imbued with the warmth and beauty that come with the bare stone walls that typify the character of this particular restaurant. Chef Iñaki Bretal creates modern cooking with clearly evident Galician and maritime roots (he buys his fish and seafood daily from the auction in Ribeira), demonstrating high levels of technique and not being afraid to incorporate touches of fusion, taking flavours acquired on his travels (Mexico, Japan, Germany, Canada etc) and merging them with what he refers to as “the very best of the best ingredients”. In addition to a meticulous à la carte, he offers two interesting tasting menus (Currican and Palangre) that vary in their number of courses, as well as an extensive wine list, from which young sommelier Raquel Fernández (who is also in charge of the dining room) creates some surprising wine pairings.

MICHELIN Guide: Good cooking
Through the name of this restaurant, located along an attractive, narrow pedestrian street in the old quarter of town, the aim is to pay homage to a traditional form of fishing that, through the generations, has been fundamental to the livelihood of owner-chef Antonio Novas’ family. It boasts a bar at the entrance that is reminiscent of an old Galician tavern, a welcoming stone-walled dining room on the first floor, plus a private space for small events above it. Here, the cuisine is centred around top-quality ingredients and touches of contemporary and international influence, including daily recommendations that never fail to impress. Standout dishes include the signature croquettes (including those prepared with cuttlefish in ink), fish of the day and, for dessert, the creamy baked cheesecake with seasonal fruit jam.
